**<big>Midterm project outline</big>**. Find a time series dataset of your choice. Carry out a time series analysis, taking advantage of what we have learned so far in this course. Write a report, as an R markdown (Rmd) file. Data can be read by the Rmd file directly from an internet source, copied into the Rmd file, or submitted as an additional file zipped up together with the Rmd file. The deadline is 5pm on Monday March 9. 

---------

**<big>Choice of data</big>**. The time series should hopefully have at least 100 time points. You can have less, if your interests demand it. Shorter data needs additional care, since model diagnostics and asymptotic approximations become more delicate on small datasets. If your data are longer than, say, 1000 time points, you can subsample if you start having problems working with too much data. Come ask me if you have questions or concerns about your choice of data.

----------

**<big>Data privacy and project anonymity</big>**. The projects, together with their data and source code, will be posted anonymously on the class website unless you have particular reasons why this should not be done. For example, you may have access to data with privacy concerns. The projects will be posted anonymously. After the semester is finished, you can request for your name to be added to your project if you want to.

---------

**<big>Expectations for the report</big>**. The report will be graded on the following categories.

* Communicating your data analysis. [10 points]

    + Raising a question. You should explain some background to the data you chose, and give motivation for the reader to appreciate the purpose of your data analysis. 

    + Reaching a conclusion. You should say what you have concluded about your question(s).

    + You will submit your source code, but you should not expect the reader to study it. If the reader has to study the source code, your report probably has not explained well enough what you were doing.

* Statistical methodology. [10 points]

    + Justify your choices for the statistical methodology.

    + The models and methods you use should be fully explained, either by references or within your report.

    + Focus on a few, carefully explained and justified, figures, tables, statistics and hypothesis tests. You may want to try many things, but only write up evidence supporting how the data help you to get from your question to your conclusions. Value the reader's time: you may lose points for including material that is of borderline relevance, or that is not adequately explained and motivated.

* Scholarship. [10 points]

    + Your report should make references where appropriate. For a well-written report the citations should be clearly linked to the material. The reader should not have to do detective work to figure out what assertion is linked to what reference.

    + You should properly acknowledge any sources (people or documents or internet sites) that contributed to your project. You are welcome, and encouraged, to look at previous projects. If you address a question related to a previous project, you must put your contribution in the context of the previous work and explain how your approach varies or extends the previous work.

    + When using a reference to point the reader to descriptions elsewhere, you should provide a brief summary in your own report to make it self-contained. 


----------

**<big>Plagiarism</big>**. If material is taken directly from another source, that source must be cited and the copied material clearly attributed to the source, for example by the use of quotation marks. Failing to do this is [plagiarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism) and will, at a minimum, result in zero credit for the scholarship category and the section of the report in which the plagiarism occurs. Further discussion of plagiarism can be found in [On Being a Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research: Third edition (2009)](http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12192), by <i>The National Academies Press</i>.
Here is how the [Rackham Academic and Professional Integrity Policy](http://www.rackham.umich.edu/current-students/policies/academic-policies/section11#1132) describes plagiarism:

> <b> 11.2.2 Plagiarism </b>
>
> Includes:
>
>    Representing the words, ideas, or work of others as one’s own in writing or presentations, and failing to give full and proper credit to the original source.
>
>    Failing to properly acknowledge and cite language from another source, including paraphrased text.
>
>    Failing to properly cite any ideas, images, technical work, creative content, or other material taken from published or unpublished sources in any medium, including online material or oral presentations, and including the author’s own previous work.
